Savannah Mastrangelo 
Assignment 1-- Portfolio

This is my submission for assignment 1. There are a lot of commits because
I did not realize the lag time between making changes and seeing those 
changes reflected on the actual site, and spent time trying to find
errors in my code that were not there. I intend to eventually add more 
styling and information, but as of right now this submission 
covers all of the requirements of the assignment.
